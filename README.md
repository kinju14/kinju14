- *The Almanack of Naval Ravikant* – On wealth, happiness, and decision-making  
- *Ikigai* – Finding purpose through simplicity and joy

### 🌻 Plant Care Tips from a Plant Mom

- 🪴 Water your plants **only when the top inch of soil is dry**—don’t overwater!
- ☀️ Most houseplants love **bright, indirect sunlight**. Rotate them weekly!
- 🌬️ Let your plant **breathe**—clean leaves once a week with a soft cloth.
- 🐛 Neem oil = natural pesticide. Keep it handy!
- 📅 Schedule a monthly “plant spa day” for repotting, trimming, and loving!
